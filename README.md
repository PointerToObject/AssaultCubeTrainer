# Assault Cube Trainer

basically, i started the game hacking bible from guided hacking because i wasnt happy with my progression so far. i started it 6/6/2024, and I just finished my assault cube trainer with a couple things that i found,
like fire rate lol. its an awesome book with a ton of useful shit to learn, I highly reccomend it. here are some pictures of it
